# Brain Tumor Detection Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models to detect brain tumors from MRI images. It includes traditional machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

## Features
- Upload MRI images to predict the presence of a brain tumor.
- Supports multiple models:
  - SVM
  - KNN
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - CNN
- Streamlit-based web interface for easy interaction.

## Installation
